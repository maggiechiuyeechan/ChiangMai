        description: "Wat Chedi Luang is a site that is not to be missed. The historic structure looms large, centuries of being exposed to rain shows, and you are left to wonder just how much this monument has withstood through history. Parts of the monument is missing but there is a quiet and spiritual beauty that needs to be appreciated. Surrounding the monument are beautiful buddha statues, where you can pay tribute to the religion. Donations are suggested.",

I also ordered a big english breakfast with scrambled eggs, a wonderful meal for my vacation. The barista was extremely sweet and recommended a few artistic places to check out in Chiang Mai. I also fell in love with the display of ceramics they had in the store.",

As you enter the temple, you will be amazed by the stunning golden pagoda. Just outside of the pagoda, you'll witness an overlooking view of the whole of Chiang Mai.",

        description: "Doi Inanthon is most known for the king and queen pagodas, but if you explore around the mountain, you will find many more wonders. First, I would suggest renting a car and tourguide for the day. We started with the Wachirathan falls and next proceeded to the pagodas. However, the highlight of the trip was a rarely visited hike through waterfalls and rice paddies, led by a village local. The village used to be an opium plantation but has since been used to plant chrysanthemum, and shade-grown coffee that were fair trade and organic. It was a gem of an experience as we trekked through narrow paths, bamboo bridges, and saw beautiful insects along the way.",
